    "This is a helper script that:\n",
    "1. Checks how many samples are in the original downloaded dataset\n",
    "2. Creates the directory structure for the datasets\n",
    "3. Creates the directories\n",
    "4. Splits the data into train, validation, and test sets\n",
    "5. Copies the data into the directories\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running the script you need to download the dataset from: https://github.com/Nomikxyz/retinopathy-dataset and extract the data to your computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "This script assumes that the original dataset is extracted to a sub-folder named `retinopathy-dataset-master` and this script is in the same folder. \n",
    "\n",
    "The final directory structure when the script is executed is the following:\n",
